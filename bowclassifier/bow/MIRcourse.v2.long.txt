How to use the bow program (bag of words):
To run the bowimagetrieval on linux (rm. 303):

(1)enter into Debug directory under bowimagetrieval 
(2)enter the command:
   make clean
(3)enter the command:
   make
(4)enter the command, we can choose different query image in queryimages:
   ./bowimageretrieval ../data/queryimages/image_0034.jpg ranklist.html

check the retrieval result ranklist.html in the Debug folder
for the bowimagesretrieval, if you want to change the dictionary size:
find the size define of the dictionary size in the top of the maintest.cpp
#define  DictionarySize 50 
/*note that: if we already obtained the SIFT local features, Dictionary and Bowfeatures, just run the following codes in the main function:*/
	cv::Mat Dictionary;
	Load_Dictionary(Dictionary);
	cout<<"Dictionary Loaded"<<endl;
	Query_Test(argv[1],argv[2],BOWdataset_path,Dictionary);
/*note that: if we already compiled and just changed the main function, using the following command:*/
(1) make bowimageretrieval
(2)enter the command, we can choose different query image in queryimages:
   ./bowimagetrieval ../data/queryimages/image_0034.jpg ranklist.html


To run the bowclassification on linux:
(1)enter into the Debug directory under bowclassification 
(2)enter the command:
   make clean
(3)enter the command:
   make
(4)enter the command, we can choose different query image in queryimages:
   ./bowclassification ../data/queryimages/image_0032.jpg

it will output the result: which category the query image belongs to.
for the bowclassification, if you want to change the dictionary size:
find the size define of the dictionary size in the top of the maintest.cpp
#define  DictionarySize 50 
/*note that: if we already obtained the SIFT local features, Dictionary, Bowfeatures and SVM, just run the following codes in the main function:*/

	//GetFolderList
        DIR * dir;
        struct dirent * ptr;
        char pathbuf[500];
        strcpy(pathbuf, Timagefilepath.c_str());
        dir = opendir(pathbuf);
        
        while((ptr = readdir(dir)) != NULL)
        {
	   if(!strstr(ptr->d_name, "."))
	   {
		   categories.push_back(ptr->d_name);
		   cout<< ptr->d_name <<endl;
	   }
        }
        closedir(dir);

        cv::Mat Dictionary;
	
	Load_Dictionary(Dictionary);
	
	CvSVM svm;
        
	svm.load(svmclassifier_path.c_str());
	int ID=Query_Predict(argv[1],svm,Dictionary);
	cout<<categories[ID].c_str()<<endl;
/*note that: if we already complied and just changed the main function, using the following command:*/
(1) make bowclassification
(2)enter the command, we can choose different query image in queryimages:
   ./bowclassification ../data/queryimages/image_0032.jpg
