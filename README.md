# Salient Feature Extraction for Image Classification
 
**General:**
<br>
This repo contains a C++ implementation of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Random sample consensus (RANSAC) for 1) salient feature detection across 2 images, 2) image similarity between i) a reference image and ii) two comparison images and 3) a bag of words (BOW) classifier utilizing extracted features from the SIFT and RANSAC procedure.
