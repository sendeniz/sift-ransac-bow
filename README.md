# Salient Feature Extraction for Image Classification
 
**General:**
<br>
This repo contains a C++ implementation of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Random sample consensus (RANSAC) for image similarity and image classification using a Bag of Words (BoW) classifier. Salient feature are visualised and matching features are shown before and after RANSAC.
